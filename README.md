# ML-Data-Visualization

## Origin

I'm currently in fifth semester of my cs bachelor in University Leipzig in Germany. This repository is used to contain the code of the data visualization app (dash), which is one part of my course "Interactive Data Visualization Analysis" (originate from german). In this course to complete practical part (building a visualization app) is the prerequisite for joining the final exam, this is how many Uni in Germany works.
This is supposed to be a group work, you should be able to see the contributions somehow. 

I use plotly to build visualization part and sklearn for machine learning, this is also requirement of this course.

- Visualization: about this there is not much to say, I'm leanring from beginning to build dash app and visualize the result at least I feel ok for now, since it's only a part of course, there is not much time to optimize this.
- Machine Learning
  - data preparation
  - classification (decision tree, k-nearest neighbor)
  - regression (linear, logical)
  - clustering (k-means, k++)
  - evaluation (cross-validation, bootstraping, confusion matrix)
  - support vector machine
  - artifical neural network
- Data source: the data was given by the course, I also include them in my repository, if it breaks copyright, I will take them out, please let me know. Thank you!

## To be updated

I hope I will use this starting point to develop and gain more knowledge about ML and data visualization.
